    "aboutme": `Iâ€™m Matthew Baldwin, a full-stack web developer. I am passionate about programming and using new development tools and technology. For the past seven years I have worked in a corporate healthcare data industry involved in digital marketing campaigns.
    
    My previous experiences included analyzing customer experiences through website landing pages, content creation and email automation tools such as Pardot and Eloqua. I have over a decade of experience with Adobe Suite creating content in Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I have managed websites as part of my marketing duties and developed them using HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and managing CMS platforms. This allowed me to create a passion for coding and developing websites and their technologies. I was fortunate to take on more responsibility coding and developing these corporate websites and learned more about JavaScript and project management platforms. 
    
    I needed a way to learn more and enrolled at LearningFuze, and take night classes while still holding my job. While at Learning Fuze I was given challenging programming problems to solve. Engaging me and exposing me to more technologies such as JavaScript, jQuery, React and NodeJs. My knowledge grew as a front end developer as I worked on several React applications. NodeJs and Express exposed me to working as a back-end developer as I edited databases and made even more progress. 
    
    My experience managing campaigns for customer experiences combined with my skills as a Web Developer would make me a fantastic asset to your team. I would love the opportunity to bring my passion and dedication to web development to your company.`,
