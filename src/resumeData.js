    "aboutme": `I’m Matthew Baldwin, a full-stack web developer and experienced marketer. I'm passionate about programming and constantly exploring new development tools and technologies. For the past seven years, I’ve worked in the corporate healthcare data industry, primarily within digital marketing — but it was in that space that I discovered my deeper interest in coding and web development.`,
    "aboutme2": `
    Early in my career, I focused on optimizing customer experiences through website landing pages, content creation, and marketing automation platforms like Pardot and Eloqua. I also drew on over a decade of experience with Adobe Creative Suite — Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign — to build high-quality creative assets. As my responsibilities expanded, I found myself managing corporate websites, diving into front-end code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and working with various CMS platforms. This blend of creativity and technical work sparked a lasting passion for web development.`,
    "aboutme3": `
    As I began taking on more coding responsibilities, I realized I wanted to go deeper. To challenge myself and accelerate my learning, I enrolled at LearningFuze — attending intensive night classes while continuing to work full-time. There, I tackled complex programming challenges and gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, jQuery, React, and Node.js. I built several front-end applications in React, and expanded into back-end development with Node.js, Express, and database management. That immersive experience solidified my identity as a developer.`,
    "aboutme4": `
    Today, I bring a rare combination of skills: a background in digital marketing and customer engagement, paired with hands-on experience in web development and programming. I thrive in cross-functional environments and love building solutions that are both technically sound and user-centered. I'd be excited to bring this passion, dedication, and hybrid skill set to your team.`,
